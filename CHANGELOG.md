# 📝 Changelog

All changes to the **Hearts of Modding** extension will be documented in this file.

## [v0.26.3] - 2026-08-14

### 🧹 Internal

> new segment, yippee

- **Release workflow runs now carry descriptive names** like "Release (minor)" in the Actions list, and post a job summary with the actual released version, bump type, and previous version.

- **Release descriptions now include the last 3 patch versions** instead of just the current patch + its parent minor, so upgrading from an older patch shows the intermediate fixes.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **The LSP now reconnects after repeated server exits** instead of permanently giving up after a burst of failures, such as when opening a large file that produces many logs.

## [v0.26.2] - 2026-08-13

### 🔧 Changed

- Dependency updates.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **The "Fix all styling issues in this file" bulk action now also adds the trailing newline.**

## [v0.26.1] - 2026-08-13

### ✨ Added

- **Dynamic semantic highlighting for ideology-derived modifier names like `communism_drift` or `democratic_acceptance`.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **[PR #14](https://github.com/emberglazee/hearts-of-modding/pull/14): The LSP now stays responsive during a workspace scan.**

  - Thanks to @jiangji0721!

## [v0.26.0] - 2026-08-13

### ✨ Added

- **Releases now publish a `SHA256SUMS` file** covering the VSIX and all six standalone LSP binaries, so downloads can be verified with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`. CI builds attach one for their VSIX too.

- **Downloaded LSP binaries are verified before use.** On platforms where the server isn't bundled, the extension checks the download against the release checksum and refuses to install it on mismatch, rather than quietly trying a different release — previously a truncated transfer, or an error page served with HTTP 200 by a proxy, would be cached and reused forever. Releases published before checksums existed still install as before, but a checksum that can't be fetched at all no longer counts as "no checksum". Binaries from older extension versions are also cleaned up now.

- **The log now says which extension and server builds are actually running.** Startup records the extension version, the `hom-lsp` version and where the server binary came from — bundled, downloaded from a specific release, reused from cache, or a local build — and warns when the two don't match. Previously a stale or mismatched server looked identical to a working one, and telling them apart meant digging through the extensions directory by hand.

- **Structured-block sub-key awareness:** For a lot of relevant modifiers/triggers/effects, documented scope data for their sub-keys/parameters, e.g. `add_timed_idea = { idea = ... days = ... }`. Sub-keys are semantically highlighted, hover shows their type and description, and completion offers them first.

- **Text files anywhere under `gfx/` now use HoM's `hoi4` language mode.** The vanilla tree keeps script data across many subfolders (`army_icons`, `3dviewenv`, `interface/equipmentdesigner/graphic_db`, `maparrows`, `particles`, `train_gfx_database`, plus `naval_combat.txt`/`posteffect_volumes.txt`), and mods may add custom folders of their own, so a single `**/gfx/**/*.txt` association replaces per-folder entries. Font license files under `gfx/fonts/` stay plain text (they're not script).

### 🔧 Changed

- **Renaming is dramatically faster in large mods.** The position index was rebuilt for every nested block instead of once per file; a single pass over a 100 KB event file went from ~175ms to ~0.17ms.

- **File validation no longer blocks the LSP event loop.** An open file's diagnostics were produced synchronously on the server's message loop, so validating a large file (seconds of work) stalled every other LSP request — hover, completion, and edits to other files all hung until it finished. Validation now runs on a bounded compute pool behind a cheap Arc-clone of the shared server state (the rust-analyzer `Analysis` pattern), leaving the event loop free. Workspace scanning already used the same pool.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **[PR #13](https://github.com/emberglazee/hearts-of-modding/pull/13): The bundled Windows amd64 server no longer exits immediately on systems without the Visual C++ Redistributable.** Windows MSVC release binaries now link the C runtime statically, and CI starts the packaged executable and verifies an LSP initialize response before publishing it.

  - Thanks to @jiangji0721!

- **Quick fixes for spacing no longer crash the LSP on lines with non-English characters.** Requesting a code action on a line containing something like `café` could abort the request, as could a brace-spacing fix on a line whose closing brace fell outside the highlighted range.

- **The `hoi4.logLevel` setting now does something.** It was declared in the settings UI and handled by the server, but the extension never actually sent it — so the server always ran at `info` no matter what you picked, and `debug`/`trace` could never be used to diagnose anything.

- **Enabling scope validation (HOM004) now survives a restart.** The setting was only sent to the server when you changed it mid-session, so it reverted to off on every window reload and the scope diagnostics you'd switched on quietly disappeared.

- **Editing resources, state categories, continents or country tag aliases now takes effect immediately.** These four were only ever read on startup, so changes needed a window reload and deleting a file left its entries behind — most visibly, a removed tag alias kept producing wrong diagnostics in `common/country_tags/`.

- **Toggling the LSP off and back on left the extension half-broken.** The log panel command was re-registered on every start, which threw after the server was already up — silently skipping the color code listener (leaving loc colours on wiki defaults) and the RAM usage indicator.

- **Downloading the server no longer hangs startup indefinitely.** On platforms without a bundled binary, a stalled or black-holed network left the extension starting up forever with no error and no way to tell what it was waiting on — the request had no time limit at all. Downloads now give up and fall back to a local build instead.

- **Toggling the LSP no longer leaks file watchers or leaves stray server processes behind.** Every off→on cycle created two more workspace-wide file watchers that were never released, and toggling quickly — before the previous start or stop had finished — could launch a second `hom-lsp` that the extension then lost track of, leaving it running with a full workspace scan in memory and no way to stop it short of reloading the window.

- **HOM6004 (`MALFORMED_LEADING_DOT_NUMBER`) no longer fires on identifiers containing non-English characters.** Accented and Cyrillic names are valid in HOI4 (vanilla uses them in `00_names.txt`), so IDs like `crisé.12` or `событие.1` were wrongly reported as errors. Genuine `.5` values are still caught.

- **3 color code rename bugs:**

  - Accidental mid-character slicing causing a critical LSP crash;
  - Byte offsets emitted as UTF-16 columns, drifting edits off-target;
  - Range width in bytes, causing each edit to be one unit too wide.

- **Opening or editing a huge map data file no longer wedges the server.** `map/unitstacks.txt` and other line-oriented data files (`supply_nodes.txt`, `definition.csv`, …) were run through the HOI4 script parser on every open and edit. The engine never parses these as scripts, and the script parser's recovery is O(n²) on brace-less files scanned from the start — a 10 MB unitstacks.txt (264k lines) took minutes per keystroke, and diagnostics never appeared. These files now skip the script parse entirely (validation stays line-based and instant), and the parser's brace-resync recovery is guarded by a whole-file brace pre-scan so no large brace-less file can ever trigger the quadratic path.

## [v0.25.3] - 2026-08-06

### ✨ Added

- **HOM4004 (`IDEA_CASE_MISMATCH`) hint level diagnostic.** Offers a code action to fix the case mismatch.

### 🔧 Changed

- **National ideas are now parsed without case sensitivity to fire HOM4004 instead of "Unknown idea".**

## [v0.25.2] - 2026-08-06

### ✨ Added

- **HOM4003 `IDEA_PICTURE_NOT_FOUND` code for an existing related warning diagnostic.**

### 🔧 Changed

- **HOM5009 (`DECISION_DUAL_COST`) now fires only for decisions with both `cost > 0` and `custom_cost_trigger`.**

  - Decisions with both `custom_cost_trigger` and `cost = 0` are observed 71 times in vanilla as of 1.19.2.0.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **HOM005 (`MISSING_LOCALIZATION`) no longer fires on scripted localization identifiers.**

- **Idea parsing fixes to prevent false HOM4003 diagnostics.**

## [v0.25.1] - 2026-08-05 (Hotfix)

### ✨ Added

- **Go to definition (F12) for states and provinces.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **False HOM5008 on `remove_effect`-only decisions.**

## [v0.25.0] - 2026-08-05

### ✨ Added

- **Changing `hoi4.modRegistryPath` now prompts a reload.**

- **Associated `portraits/**/*.txt` with HoM's `hoi4` language mode.**

- **Scan `common/continuous_focuses/**/*.txt` as focuses.**

- **Localization file cache** to avoid wasteful re-parsing.

- **Reverse per-path index for workspace variables.**

- **Recognize mission and timer type decisions** to prevent false HOM5008 `DECISION_MISSING_COMPLETE_EFFECT` diagnostics.

### 🔧 Changed

- **Slightly optimized the extension VSIX file size.**

- **Optimized the localization color decorator.**

- **Optimized the localization parsing done by the hover handler and localization validation.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed wrong balance of power and character portrait paths in overlay prefix and scanners.**

- **Fixed call hierarchy and localization goto-definition UTF-16 inception bugs.**

- **Removed provably dead localization scans that resulted in wasted O(N)** from the hover handler, entity lookup, and the events parser.

- **Resolve the map files per-URI instead of server CWD.**

- **Incremental scanner now correctly re-inserts layers at their correct priority.**

- **Client color-code query raced the workspace scan resulting in only the default color codes being displayed.** Now event-driven by the server instead.

- **Toggling `hoi4.validator.scopeValidationEnabled` while the LSP was running had no effect** until a server restart. The setting is now applied live via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`.

- **Fixed incremental updates on Windows never matching the file's own stored entries.**

- **Fixed scripted localization being dropped during scans.** Long standing bug since the v0.17.0 VFS overhaul.

## [v0.24.1] - 2026-08-03

### ✨ Added

- **Experimental LSP support for ARM64 Linux and Windows, as well as AMD64 (Intel) MacOS.** Not bundled with the extension (only AMD64 Linux and Windows, and ARM64 MacOS are bundled), downloaded separately upon extension install/update.

## [v0.24.0] - 2026-08-03

> been a while, eh?

***The biggest update since v0.14.0.***

### ⭐ Highlights

- ⭐ **Scope V2 refactor:** Rewrote the scope system from the ground up.

- **Continued fixes for multi-byte characters in UTF-8 files, and parser improvements.**

### ✨ Added

- **Introduced `Modifier Bag` scope for the scope stack** to avoid scope classification issues in modifier blocks like `country_modifier` or `unit_modifier`. Will be revisited at a later date.

- **Ace scanner:** Scans `common/aces/*.txt` for ace categories.

- **The RAM usage indicator in the status bar now shows when the LSP is busy processing something.**

### 🔧 Changed

- ⭐ **Scope V2 refactor:** Rewrote the scope system from the ground up. Scope validation is experimental, incomplete due to sheer scale. Opt-in via `hoi4.validator.scopeValidationEnabled` boolean configuration property.

- **Improved scope stack for focuses.** Introduced custom `Focus Tree` and `National Focus` scopes.

- **Improved UTF-16 char handling in UTF-8 script files.**

- **Continued parser improvements:** Skip comments between assignment and a starting block at a new line (`SOV_CAV_02 = #COSSACK CAVALRY\n{`), recover from stray closing braces and erroneous section signs in script files.

- Dependency updates.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Allowed curly quotes and apostrophe as identifier chars.** Commonly used in character names (`“Lha-bzang”`, `“Savas’jan”`) but causing parsing errors due to these chars not being ASCII alphanumeric.

- **Fixed wrong offset calculations in semantic highlighting for multi-byte chars in script files.**

- **Event namespace ordering checks are now prevented for nested event calls.** Those caused false `HOM3008` (`MISSING_EVENT_NAMESPACE`) diagnostics.

- **Fixed parsing of `hidden = yes` in events.** Led to wrongful `HOM3016` (`EVENT_MISSING_TITLE`) diagnostics. Neither titles nor pictures are expected for `hidden` events.

> ...and _many_ more undocumented changes and fixes, i had to shift my workflows to better understand my own codebase due to how huge it got

> full list of 100+ commits: https://github.com/emberglazee/hearts-of-modding/compare/v0.23.1...v0.24.0

## [v0.23.1] - 2026-06-30

### 🔧 Changed

- **Optimized the log panel for a large amount of log entries.** Should feel more performant now.

- **Parallel scanning of workspace files for diagnostics.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed the log entries disappearing from the log panel after switching to another panel.**

- **Fixed the `"Warning: No keys found in localization file"` log message being misleadingly `[INFO]` level.**

- **Fixed false `HOM5007` (`CATEGORY_KEY_IN_DECISION`) diagnostics for category-only keys at sub-block depths within a decision.**

## [v0.23.0] - 2026-06-30

### ✨ Added

- ⭐ **Decision scanner:** Scan, parse, and validate decisions and decision categories.

- **Event and scanner data dependency graphs** to ensure better workspace data synchronization.

- **Added more missing keywords to the list of semantic tokens.**

### 🔧 Changed

- **Parser improvements:** Correctly handle commas as value separators within blocks and omitted closing brackets at the end of files.

## [v0.22.2] - 2026-06-28 (Hotfix)

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed case-insensitivity not working correctly for event namespaces.**

## [v0.22.1] - 2026-06-28 (Hotfix)

### 🔧 Changed

- **Dead code cleanup.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed namespace ordering validation applying to `country_event` uses as an effect.**

## [v0.22.0] - 2026-06-28

### ✨ Added

- **Added more missing keywords to the list of semantic tokens.**

- **Distinctive semantic highlighting for booleans (`yes`/`no`) and meta-scopes (`ROOT`, `FROM`, `PREV`, `THIS`).**

### 🔧 Changed

- ⭐ **Better event namespace validation:** Same-file namespace after event, cross-file namespace ordering, case-insensitive namespace lookup, vanilla namespaces, ignoring `events/` subdirectories.

- **Raised severity of diagnostic `HOM3008` (`MISSING_EVENT_NAMESPACE`) from a warning to an error.** Not declaring a namespace causes `Malformed token` errors and the game fails to register the events.

- **Lowered severity of diagnostic `HOM3012` (`DUPLICATE_EVENT_NAMESPACE`) from a warning to information.** The game silently merges the two declarations into one internal ID without any error logs.

- **General improvements for diagnostics `HOM3017` to `HOM3020`.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Quoted strings in event titles no longer trigger error diagnostic `HOM3018` (`EVENT_MISSING_TITLE_LOC`).**

## [v0.21.2] - 2026-06-27

### ✨ Added

- Added missing `hidden_effect` keyword to the list of semantic tokens.

### 🔧 Changed

- **Minor improvements to the log panel:** Milliseconds in the timestamp, and additional buttons to copy the logs, or export them as a file.

- **Slight refactor for the localization scan logging.**

- **Updated dependencies.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Optimize localization content validation.**

## [v0.21.1] - 2026-06-16

### 🔧 Changed

- **Slight refactor to reduce scanner boilerplate code.**

- **Better `common/countries/*.txt` scanning.**

- Updated dev dependencies.

## [v0.21.0] - 2026-06-15

> its becoming a bit too burdensome

### ✨ Added

- **Experimental log tab:** Allows the extension log to be displayed in a prettier way. Open with `Hearts of Modding: Show Log Panel`.

  - Will not be documented in the README.md yet due to its current lack of features.

### 🔧 Changed

- **Various optimizations to improve the extension performance.**

- **More logging messages for troubleshooting.**

- **Updated dependencies.**

## [v0.20.0] - 2026-06-11

### ✨ Added

- **Event namespace, ID, and option validation.**

### 🔧 Changed

- **Better semantic highlighting in events.**

- **Meta-scope resolution refactor.**

- **Precomputed lookup table for ASCII identifier characters.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed duplicate detection in vanilla files:** If your workspace has the same path as `hoi4.gamePath` (so your workspace is your specified HOI4 install) the extension will no longer give false warnings about duplicates.

- **Fixed wrongful duplicate key warnings for `icon` in `gfx/army_icons/army_icons.txt`, and for `add_province_modifier = { province = { id = 1 id = 2 }`.**

- **Fixed relative path resolution for locally created mods in manual descriptor files.**

## [v0.19.1] - 2026-06-10

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed handling of Windows paths in the `FileOverlay` introduced in v0.17.0 as part of the VFS refactor.** Addresses [issue #5](https://github.com/emberglazee/hearts-of-modding/issues/5).

  > the joys of developing on and testing only for linux.

## [v0.19.0] - 2026-06-10

### ✨ Added

- **Ignore known non-script vanilla files when parsing.**

### 🔧 Changed

- **Updated dependencies.**

- **Minor refactors.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fix buggy semantic highlighting when adding or removing lines from a document.**

## [v0.18.0] - 2026-06-07

### ✨ Added

- **Respect `replace_path` in the mod descriptor file.**

- **Order of Battle (`history/units/*.txt`) scanner.** Self-validates division templates.

- **Unit (`common/units/*.txt`) scanner.** Units are validated within OOBs.

- **Missing bookmark related keywords.**

- `x` and `y` (in `.gui`s, OOBs, etc) are now semantically highlighted in a distinctive color.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed an air wings OOB edge-case where HoM was emitting a `duplicate_key` warning for multiple `name` keys being under the same state scope under respective equipment types (planes).** This is *required* to name air wings when there are more than one of them in the same state/airfield.

- **Fixed an issue where `did_change_watched_files` only updated the scan data, never re-validated open documents whose diagnostics could depend on that data.**

- **Fixed semantic highlighting of the date in a bookmark.**

## [v0.17.0] - 2026-06-07

### ✨ Added

- ⭐ **VSCode decorators for localization text:** Shows the color the text will be right in the editor. Supports custom color codes.

- **Highlight newline (`\n`) and escaped double quotes (`\"`) in localization text.**

- **Bracket-matching error recovery:** Missing brackets should no longer cause as many cascading parse failures through the rest of the file.

- **Added some more missing keywords.**

### 🔧 Changed

- ‼️ **Extension activation behavior** has been changed and clarified:

  - **"Extension activation" now only means when VSCode runs the extension code.**

  - **Command `Hearts of Modding: Activate Extension` is replaced with `Hearts of Modding: Toggle LSP`:** controls the setting to either enable or disable the LSP on extension activation.

    - **Users get reminded when they have the LSP off and get prompted to enable it. That prompt can be supressed.**

  - **VSCode now should only automatically activate the extension if it sees `descriptor.mod` in the workspace root directory (`./descriptor.mod`).**

- ⭐ **Massive virtual filesystem refactor:** Overhauled the VFS to more closely resemble the HOI4 mod loading behavior.

- **Improved variable scanning.**

- **Slightly optimized the algorithm that checks for unescaped quotes in localization.**

- **Fast-path check for `parse_identifier_value` to avoid unnecessary CPU-heavy 64-bit float parsing.**

- **Optimized quoted string parsing.**

- **...and many other optimizations.**

- **Better handle parsing the ignored files list (`hoi4.validator.ignoreFiles`).**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **String interner memory leak:** The interner stored every interned string forever. Implemented a garbage collector to solve this.

- **Miscelaneous idea scanner fixes.**

## [v0.16.1] - 2026-06-04

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed sprite scanner not detecting other sprite types.**

- **Fixed false "Texture file not found" warnings** caused by looking for texture files in the wrong directory.

## [v0.16.0] - 2026-06-04

Mostly addressing some long-time deeply rooted issues within the extension.

### ✨ Added

- **Implemented range-based semantic token request support**, reducing the CPU usage in huge files.

### 🔧 Changed

- **Optimized localization string offset calculation.**

- **Debounce AST parsing and cancel ongoing stale AST parsing** while actively editing a file to further decrease stutter and wasted processing.

- **AST ByteSpan optimization:** AST nodes now store start/end byte offsets instead of raw text for lower memory usage and faster parse times.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed the `styling_assignment_space` diagnostic not being emitted.**

- **Fixed workspace scan diagnostics being broken for AST-dependent checks.**

- **Fixed the ability scanner.**

- **Correct the army/naval leader max skill levels:** Skill level 9 (hardcap), and sub-skill level 10 (practical cap).

## [v0.15.1] - 2026-06-04

### 🔧 Changed

- **Asynchronous AST updates** to reduce stutter while actively editing a file.

- **Hidden ideas are no longer expected to have a picture.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed an idea picture validation bug which caused the LSP to check for a picture in the wrong (idea category) scope.**

## [v0.15.0] - 2026-06-03

### ✨ Added

- ⭐ ***Experimental submod support:*** Introduced a mod discovery system (only activates if the base game path is set) that allows the extension to mimic how HoI4 handles mod dependencies (submods).

- **Balance of Power scanner:** Parsing and highlighting for `common/bop/*.txt` files.

- **Terrain scanner:** Parsing, highlighting, and validation for `common/terrain/*.txt` terrain definitions and their uses for strategic region naval terrain and `definition.csv` province terrain.

- **Centralized AST Visitor:** File edit performance optimization by introducing a centralized AST visitor.

### 🔧 Changed

- **Refactored workspace file watcher** to properly track file creations, changes, and deletions.

- **VFS refactor:** Refactored the Virtual File System and how it overrides existant vanilla files to make it more reliable and allow submod support.

- **Rewrote `README.md`** to better describe the current functionality of the extension.

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Fixed URI-to-file-path conversion for call hierarchy and symbol rename** for Windows users.

## [v0.14.1] - 2026-06-03

### ✨ Added

- **Added a prompt offering to switch to the custom VSCode theme for workspaces where HoM is active.**

### 🩹 Fixed

- **Corrected `README.md` to mention the higher minimal VSCode version requirement to v1.82.0.**

## [v0.14.0] - 2026-06-03

***The home stretch to v1.0.0 is here.***

### ✨ Added

- **Huge semantic highlighting improvements:**

  - **Custom Light/Dark VSCode theme:** Introduced a custom Hearts of Modding VSCode theme that greatly expands the potential for richer semantic highlighting.

  - **Semantic highlighting for localization and `.csv` map files** with the new custom Hearts of Modding VSCode theme set.

- **Validation for country tags in localization commands.**

- **Expanded state scanner:** Validation for custom resources, buildings, and state categories, with expanded semantic highlighting.

- **Country metadata scanner:** Scan and validate `country_metadata/*.txt` GFX.

- **Added more missing keywords to semantic highlighting.**

### 🔧 Changed

- **Bumped up the minimal VSCode version requirement to v1.82.0.**

- **Massive internal LSP refactor:**

  - **Split `advanced_validation.rs` and `backend.rs` into a more coherent code structure.**

  - **Implemented Reverse Index for localization, and String Interning** for memory optimization wherever possible.

  - (finally) **Sorted and organized the 80+ flat Rust files into separate directories.**

  - **Switched from `malloc` to `@emberglazee/jemalloc`** (personal `jemalloc` fork fixing Windows support) resulting in lower RAM usage.

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Improved semantic token highlighting for ideology, idea, national focus, and music definitions.**

## [v0.12.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Move trigger, effect, and modifier definitions to a static JSON file** rather than a hardcoded Rust file.

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Continued general LSP refactors** to increase maintainability and improve the code architecture. I do not wanna end up like [PirateSoftware](https://youtu.be/HHwhiz0s2x8?t=250).

## [v0.11.3] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Several more miscellaneous LSP optimizations to ensure a smoother experience.

### Fixed

- **Wrongful diagnostics column calculation for localization:** A sequel to the **Critical localization-related LSP crash** in v0.11.2. Fixed wrongful diagnostic offsets when the line had UTF-16 characters like the paragraph sign.

  - > my brain hurts

## [v0.11.2] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Several more optimizations for the LSP to ensure a smoother experience.

### Fixed

- **Critical localization-related LSP crash:** Fixed an LSP crash when trying to autocomplete after the paragraph sign (for color codes) in localization, caused by incorrect handling of 1 UTF-16 code unit vs 2 UTF-8 bytes.

## [v0.11.1] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **Localization key overrides:** Now there's a warning for duplicate localization keys only if they are defined twice in the mod, as vanilla game overrides are intentional (in most cases).

- **Localization regex optimization:** Compile regular expressions outside of localization validation functions, solving a critical performance bottleneck during workspace validation.

  - Applies to both localization validation and preview.

### Fixed

- **Flat color code stacking:** The localization parser no longer stacks the color codes, which led to wrongful `unclosed_color_code` warnings.

  - e.g., `§4To fight for liberty and new §2freedoms!§!` is now okay.

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Custom color code validation:** Scanning .gfx files for custom defined color codes in `bitmapfonts = { textcolors = { ... } }` blocks to validate against. No more just hardcoded vanilla ones.

- **Incremental scanner:** Re-run the corresponding single-file parser on file save.

### Fixed

- **LSP memory leak:** Fixed not clearing memory (raw text and parsed AST) when closing documents (files).

- **Duplicate configuration event listeners:** Fixed a potential client-side leak where if `startServer` was to be called multiple times it would register duplicate configuration event listeners.

- **Duplicate victory point diagnostics:** Fixed the victory point validation to prevent any duplicate diagnostics.

- **Ignored province-level building count validation:** Now correctly validates province-level building counts.

- **Modern character definitions ignored:** Now detects the character type using the bare role names as well (`create_field_marshal` -> `field_marshal`).

- **High memory usage tracker CPU overhead:** Now only refreshes the LSP process to get the memory usage information, not all processes running on the system.

- **Static indices after startup:** The LSP now does incremental parsing of files that have been edited and saved after the LSP startup. (**Incremental scanner**)

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **AST cache:** Eliminated the bottleneck of having one document be parsed multiple times every single change in the document. Now it is parsed only once per change into the in-memory AST cache.

- **AI area and Continent scanner:** Handle `common/ai_areas` and `map/continent.txt`.

- **Texture path validation:** Added validation for texture paths in `.gfx` and `.gui` files.

- **Abstract Directory Traversal:** Reduced LSP boilerplate by introducing a new `walk_and_parse_files` function, which abstracts away the common pattern of traversing directories and parsing files, improving code maintainability.

### Changed

- **Migration to `tower-lsp-server`:** Migrated from `tower-lsp` v0.20.0 to `tower-lsp-server` v0.23.0 (a community fork with continued support), including a slight LSP refactor for the breaking changes.

- **Optimize case-insensitive key checks:** Optimized the way the LSP performs case-insensitive checks for keys to lessen the parsing processing overhead.

### Fixed

- **Undo escaped square brackets (v0.8.0):** Anything other than newlines (`\n`) and escaped double quotes (`\"`) is considered invalid escape sequences by the HOI4 parser, this includes square brackets. The code action to escape square brackets has been removed, and the diagnostic message has been changed to reflect this.

- **Test modules in release build:** Fixed accidentally including development test modules in release LSP builds for the extension.

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Country Scanner:** Parse, validate, and syntax highlight country tags.

### Changed

- **Major LSP refactor:** Continued LSP refactors to increase modularity and improve maintainability.

- **Improved Scripted Trigger and Effect Semantic Highlighting**: Now correctly highlights scripted triggers and effects, the same as custom advancemenets, characters, etc.

### Fixed

- **Wrongful idea GFX lookup logic:** Now replicates the correct in-game behavior of looking up the idea GFX.

  - > thank you hoi4 wiki, very cool

## [v0.8.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Custom Advancements Semantic Highlighting:**

  - Achievement names (from both regular and custom achievements) now receive TYPE (entity) highlighting in semantic tokens, making them visually distinct from keywords and plain strings.

  - `custom_achievement`, `custom_ribbon`, `key`, and `achievement` are now recognized as hardcoded keywords in semantic tokens.

### Fixed

- Fixed achievement scanner to properly handle `custom_achievement` and `custom_ribbon` blocks. The scanner now extracts identifiers from inner `achievement` and `key` fields in addition to the block key itself, supporting both naming conventions used by mods.

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **AI strategy plan support:** Parse, validate, and provide expanded syntax highlighting for `common/ai_strategy_plans/*.txt`.

- **Expanded character support:** Better syntax highlighting, validation, and completions for characters, including better portrait validation.

- **Handle escaped square brackets in localization.**

  - Having literal text inside square brackets was already handled 'literally' by HOI4 but there is no indication of intent: was it meant to be literal text or is it an invalid command? This addresses it by offering to 'escape' (e.g., `-[NON-EXISTANT]-` -> `-\[NON-EXISTANT\]-`) the square brackets with backslashes. They're correctly parsed by the HOI4 localization parser and show the intent of this being meant as literal text.

### Changed

- **Huge Rust LSP refactor:** Refactored the LSP server code to be more modular and maintainable.

### Fixed

- Stop the conflicts between TextMate and LSP semantic syntax highlighting by reducing the TextMate scope to the structural basics.

- Don't highlight entity references when a string value's parent assignment key is one of `name`, `desc`, `custom_description`, or `text`.

- Fix handling escaped square brackets in localization preview.

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Expanded Leader Ability Intelligence:**
  - Added validation for ability definitions: warns on missing `name`/`desc` localization keys, missing required fields (`cost`, `duration`, `type`), and missing `ai_will_do` block (AI will never use the ability).
  - Enhanced ability scanner to extract additional fields: `cancelable`, `cooldown`, `icon`, and block presence indicators (`allowed`, `unit_modifiers`, `one_time_effect`, `ai_will_do`).
  - Built-in fallback of 10 vanilla ability names for completions when no ability files exist in the workspace.
  - Semantic highlighting now uses token type `TYPE` for ability names (e.g. `force_attack`) to make them visually distinct from keywords.
  - `unit_modifiers` blocks now display formatted modifier tooltips on hover.
  - `one_time_effect` blocks now show a summary of contained effects on hover.
  - Added `has_ability`, `add_ability`, `remove_ability` to semantic highlighting and TextMate grammar.
  - Warning diagnostics for unknown ability names in `has_ability`/`add_ability`/`remove_ability` values.
- **Hover Documentation:**
  - Added hover documentation for `add_ability` and `remove_ability` effects.
  - Richer ability hover card now shows cooldown, cancelable flag, icon, and block presence.
- **Document Symbols:** Ability files now show `ability` blocks as `METHOD` symbols in the outline view with proper child classification for `duration`, `cooldown`, `type`, `sound_effect`, and `cancelable`.
- **Scope Inference:** Files in `common/abilities/` now start with `Character` scope for more accurate trigger/effect validation.

### Changed

- Added `name`, `desc`, `type`, `icon`, `sound_effect`, `cancelable`, `allowed`, `cooldown` to semantic token keyword highlighting.

- Added `alwaystransparent` to the casing styling check.

- Numerous LSP performance optimizations.

- Proper Workspace-wide rename symbol support, including for files that aren't opened in the editor.

- Extensive modernization throughout the LSP codebase and adopting Rust 2024 idioms by addressing `cargo clippy` errors and warnings.

### Fixed

- Properly parse localization keys with dashes (`-`) in them (TextMate syntax highlighting).

- Proper float number parsing fallback to a number type.

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- Optimized the localization parser to fix a performance bottleneck.

- Added `containerWindowType` and `origo` to the keyword casing styling check.

- Added the trailing newline check in the "Fix all styling issues" bulk code action.

- Updated Rust LSP and extension dependencies.

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Enhanced Adjacency Support:**
  - Improved `adjacency_rules.txt` scanning to extract `required_provinces` and `icon` data for use in tooltips and validation.
  - Added context-aware hover tooltips for `adjacencies.csv` that resolve province IDs (Start, End, Through) into their terrain/type and display full rule details for rule references.
  - Added completions for adjacency rule names in `adjacencies.csv` and for all `adjacency_rule` fields and sub-blocks in `adjacency_rules.txt`.
  - Implemented specialized validation for `adjacency_rules.txt` to verify that all province IDs in `required_provinces` exist in the workspace.
  - Added a sea-adjacency validation hint for `adjacencies.csv` entries missing a Through province.
  - Expanded TextMate grammar to highlight `adjacency_rule` and its associated fields (`required_provinces`, `icon`, `contested`, etc.).
- **Integrated CSV Support:**
  - Implemented a specialized CSV formatter (`csv_parser.rs`) for map definition and adjacency files. It provides semantic alignment by padding columns with spaces to match the maximum width of each column across the entire file.
  - Added support for the standard LSP `documentFormatting` command for `.csv` files.
  - Exempted `.csv` files from standard Paradox script styling checks (indentation, trailing whitespace) to allow for custom tabular formatting.
- **Context-Aware Hover Refinements:**
  - Improved the LSP's identifier resolution to track the "context key" (parent assignment or block name) during AST traversal.
  - Restricted Province, State, and Strategic Region tooltips for integers to only appear when the surrounding context is relevant (e.g., inside `provinces = { ... }` or assigned to `owns_state`). This significantly reduces false-positive tooltips when hovering over generic numbers like quantities or years.
  - Enabled hover and navigation support for `Number` and `Boolean` values in the AST, allowing tooltips to appear when hovering directly over values, not just their keys.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed a false-positive where specialized map data validation and hover tooltips were incorrectly applied to regular script files named `buildings.txt` (e.g., `common/buildings/00_buildings.txt`). These are now strictly restricted to files in the `map/` directory.
  - Fixed a diagnostic bug where `remove_ideas = all` was flagged as an "Unknown idea". The `all` keyword is now recognized as valid within this context.
- **Map Validation Improvements:**
  - Added specific validation for `map/buildings.txt` to warn about empty lines, which are counted as errors by the HOI4 engine.
  - Added a styling exception for `map/buildings.txt` to suppress the end-of-file newline diagnostic, preventing forced empty lines at the end of the file.

- Added an option to bulk fix all styling issues in a file.

## [v0.5.4] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Idea Picture Resolution & Validation:**
  - Implemented engine-accurate resolution for the `picture` field in country ideas. The extension now strictly prepends the `GFX_idea_` prefix to the `picture` attribute value, matching HOI4's internal sprite lookup.
  - Added support for graphical culture fallbacks. Validation and hover resolution now intelligently check for culture-specific variants (e.g., `_middle_eastern_2d`) when the base sprite is not found.
  - Added default picture resolution: if the `picture` field is omitted, the extension automatically validates against the implied `GFX_idea_[videa_name]` sprite.
  - Introduced a specialized internal `Idea` scope to correctly handle these context-sensitive resolution and validation rules within idea definition blocks.
- **UI Keyword Casing Diagnostic:** Expanded the keyword casing check to include `orientation` and `buttonType`. The extension now flags non-standard casing (e.g., `Orientation` or `buttontype`) in `.gui` and script files, providing links to interface modding documentation and a bulk fix to standardize casing across the entire file.
- **Major TextMate Grammar Expansion:** Significantly expanded the base TextMate syntax highlighting using official engine documentation and vanilla file analysis to provide richer, high-fidelity colors without relying on the LSP.
  - Categorized highlighting for hundreds of Effects, Triggers, and Modifiers extracted directly from the HOI4 documentation.
  - Added specialized highlighting for scopes (`ROOT`, `FROM`, etc.), 3-letter country tags, and event IDs.
  - Improved variable highlighting for `[v?var]` and scoped variables (e.g., `var:tag@name`).
  - Added full support for GUI files (`.gui`), including component types (`containerWindowType`, `buttonType`, etc.) and common UI properties (`font`, `clipping`, `shortcut`).
  - Improved numeric highlighting to support double-percentage values (e.g., `100%%`) commonly used in UI layouts.
  - Added highlighting for punctuation (braces/brackets) and hundreds of additional top-level blocks and effects.
  - Localization grammars now correctly highlight numeric color codes and bindable `$VAR$` variables.
- **Enhanced Leader Ability Support:** Expanded semantic highlighting for leader abilities to include key fields like `cost`, `duration`, `one_time_effect`, and `unit_modifiers`, ensuring better visual hierarchy in ability definition files.
- **Refined Hybrid Syntax Highlighting:** Improved the balance between TextMate and Semantic highlighting. Semantic tokens are now more conservative, only applying to known HOI4 keywords, operators, and variables. This ensures that TextMate's specialized colors for identifiers, country tags, and scopes are preserved and no longer overwritten by generic LSP tokens.

### Fixed

- **Scoped References in Ideology Fields:** `ideology = ROOT` (and other scoped references like `FROM`, `PREV`, `THIS`, `OWNER`, `CONTROLLER`, `CAPITAL`) are now recognized as valid runtime scope references instead of being flagged as unknown ideologies. This pattern is used extensively in vanilla HOI4 and workshop mods for `start_civil_war`, `add_popularity`, and similar effects.

## [v0.5.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Sound Effects Support:**
  - Added sound effects, sounds, falloffs, and sound categories to Workspace Symbols (`Ctrl+T`), enabling direct navigation to sound asset definitions.
  - Added validation for `sound_effect` references in ability files, warning when referencing undefined sound effects.

### Fixed

- **VFS-Aware Sound Effect Validation:** Sound effect scanner now scans `integrated_dlc/` and `dlc/` directories from the HOI4 game path, eliminating false-positive "Unknown sound effect" warnings for vanilla sound effects defined in DLC files.

### Removed

- Removed .cwt (CWTools) schema parsing and validation to be replaced with an alternative in a future version.

## [v0.5.2] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Updated VSCode extension dependencies, cleaned up unused dependencies.

- Bundle VSCode extension with `esbuild` for better performance.

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added static modifiers to workspace symbols.
- **Cross-File Localization Duplicate Detection:** Added a warning diagnostic for localization keys defined in multiple files across the workspace.
- **VFS-Aware Overrides:** Duplicate localization warnings intelligently respect the `replace/` folder priority, suppressing warnings when an override is intentional.

### Changed

- Updated the LSP server Rust edition to 2024, reformatted the project code, updated some dependencies.
- **Streamlined Localization Versions:** Updated validation to always flag localization version numbers (e.g., `:0`) as unnecessary. Research confirms these are purely for internal Paradox translation tracking and ignored by the game engine.

### Fixed

- **Commented Localization Parsing:** Fixed an issue where the parser incorrectly interpreted commented-out localization keys as valid entries when they were preceded by specific multi-byte characters, resolving false positive duplicate key warnings.
- **Localization Version False Positives:** Fixed a bug where version numbers were incorrectly flagged due to improper file path tracking during duplicate checks.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Leader Abilities Support:**
  - Added full support for parsing and visualizing leader abilities from `common/abilities/`.
  - Tooltips display name, description, cost, duration, and associated sound effects.
  - Hover, completion, goto definition, rename, and workspace symbols are now supported for leader abilities.
- **Scripted Localisation Support:**
  - Implemented `scripted_loc_scanner` to index scripted localization from `common/scripted_localisation/`.
  - Fixes false-positive `invalid_loc_scope` warnings in localization files when referencing valid scripted localizations.
  - Scripted localizations are now fully integrated with Hover previews, Goto Definition (`F12`), and Workspace Symbols (`Ctrl+T`).
- **State Cross-Referencing & Intelligence:**
  - Implemented a fast `state_scanner` to parse all state definitions from `history/states/`.
  - Hovering over state IDs in triggers/effects (e.g. `owns_state = 123` or `any_state_of = { 123 }`) will dynamically look up and display the corresponding state's ID, its localized in-game name, and its definition source file.
  - States are now fully searchable through Workspace Symbols (`Ctrl+T`) by both their ID (e.g. `123`) and their localized name (e.g. `Texas`).
- **Workspace Symbols Update:**
  - Added support for sub-ideologies in Workspace Symbols (`Ctrl+T`), which now displays the sub-ideology and its parent ideology context.
  - Added support for localization keys in Workspace Symbols. The search will fuzzy-match against all parsed localization string keys, displaying them as `Localisation` entries. Results are capped at 1,000 matches to ensure IDE responsiveness while searching across potentially huge localization databases.
- **Map & Logistics Intelligence:**
  - **Custom Map Configurations:** Added support for parsing `map/default.map`. The extension dynamically reads the `definitions` and `adjacencies` assignments so that renamed mapping files (e.g. custom `definition.csv` names) receive full validation, highlighting, and tooltip support. Textmate rules have been updated to recognize `.map` files as native script.
  - **Deep CSV Validation:** Integrated `definition.csv` and `adjacencies.csv` directly into the document validation pipeline. The extension performs rigorous structural checks (e.g., ensuring exact column counts, validating bounds for RGB values, verifying province types and coastal booleans, checking coordinates).
  - **Column-Snapping Tooltips:** Hovering over map `.csv`, `unitstacks.txt`, or `buildings.txt` definitions now identifies the exact column your cursor is under and displays specific, contextual metadata (e.g., resolving a Province ID column into its terrain and coastal status, or highlighting exactly what coordinate a specific integer maps to).
  - **Logistics Scanner:** Added full support for `supply_nodes.txt` and `railways.txt`, exposing them to Workspace Symbols and validating their Province IDs.
  - **Map Objects Scanner:** Parses `buildings.txt`, `unitstacks.txt`, and `weatherpositions.txt`. This enables "Jump to Definition" for map buildings/objects, validates State and Province assignments, and provides contextual hover metadata for weather positions (Strategic Region lookup).
  - **Adjacencies & Rules:** Implemented parsing for `adjacencies.csv` and `adjacency_rules.txt`. This enables cross-referencing of straits and impassable borders, and validating province connectivity rules. Descriptive header lines in `adjacencies.csv` are now correctly handled and skipped during validation.
  - **Strategic Regions:** Added `strategic_region_scanner` to process `map/strategicregions/*.txt`.
  - **Enhanced Validations:** Direct document validation now supports `.csv` and `.txt` map definition files, highlighting invalid province/state references inline without needing script AST parsing.

### Fixed

- **Parser & Styling Robustness:**
  - Fixed a critical off-by-one error in `quoted_string` range calculations. This resolves a bug where the styling engine would incorrectly insert extra spaces before the assignment operator when using quoted keys (e.g., in bookmark files).
  - Fixed an issue where strategic region files bypassed general semantic and styling checks. They now receive full validation, including assignment operator spacing and brace placement rules.
  - Fixed a validation bug in `adjacencies.csv` where the column header was incorrectly flagged as an invalid ID.

### Notes

Because this version also scans the map files expect a major jump in extension memory usage in total conversion mod code bases. You can track Rust LSP server memory usage in the status bar with the `HOI4: Show Memory Usage` command.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Character Modding Support:**
  - **Comprehensive Character Scanner:** Recursively indexes character definitions from `common/characters/`, parsing traits, skills, roles, ideologies, and portraits.
  - **Rich Hover Visualizations:** Hovering over character IDs now displays their localized name, defined roles (advisor, country leader, unit leaders), their specific stats (attack, defense, planning, logistics, etc.), and their associated traits.
  - **Portrait Previews:** Sprite (`GFX_...`) or direct file paths (`"gfx/leaders/..."`) for character portraits are dynamically resolved and linked in the tooltip for quick viewing.
  - **IDE Integration:** Added character entities to Workspace Symbols (`Ctrl+T`), enabling direct navigation to definitions.
  - **Rename Refactoring:** Full support for renaming character identifiers across all script usages (e.g., `recruit_character`, `has_character`).
  - **Syntax Highlighting:** Added semantic highlighting coverage for character-specific keywords (e.g., `characters`, `portraits`, `field_marshal`, `corps_commander`).
- **Comprehensive Trigger, Effect, and Modifier Support:**
  - Added built-in support for over 550 individual HOI4 triggers, over 530 effects, and over 550 modifiers based on the official documentation.
  - Tooltips, autocompletion, and syntax highlighting are now fully operational for virtually all game triggers, effects, and modifiers.
- **Smart Localization Fixes:**
  - **Unescaped Quote Detection:** Added a context-aware diagnostic that identifies unescaped double quotes *inside* localization values while ignoring valid delimiters and comments.
  - **Quick Fixes:** Added both individual "Escape double quote" and bulk "Escape all unescaped double quotes in this file" code actions.
- **Advanced Localization Support (Patch 1.15+):**
  - **Contextual Objects:** Support for 1.15 objects like `IndustrialOrg`, `SpecialProject`, `PurchaseContract`, and `Ace`.
  - **Ternary Logic:** Full validation and preview support for conditional localization: `[v(Object.Property ? TRUE_KEY : FALSE_KEY)]`.
  - **Localization Formatters:** Support for `<formatter>|<token>` syntax (e.g., `tech_effect|id`).
  - **Bindable Localization:** Support for `$VAR$` style bindable variables within localization strings.
  - **New Formatting Codes:** Added support for `^` (SI units) and `%%` (literal percentage sign) in variable blocks.

### Changed

- **Backend Upgrades:**
  - Updated the Rust toolchain target to 1.95.0.
  - Bumped core dependencies including `tokio` (v1.52.3), `nom` (v8.0.0), `dashmap` (v6.1.0), and `sysinfo` (v0.39.1) for improved stability and performance.
- **Improved Localization Parser:**
  - Added support for hyphens (`-`) in localization keys to match native game behavior.
  - Recognized over 10 additional localization commands (e.g., `GetDateText`, `GetBopTrendTextIcon`).
  - Improved UTF-8 BOM handling to prevent rare parsing offsets.
- **VFS Priority:** Refined the workspace scanner to ensure files in `/replace/` subdirectories correctly override keys from standard folders.

### Fixed

- **Workspace Symbols Path Resolution:** Fixed an issue where `Url::from_file_path` incorrectly generated invalid paths like `//./` for workspace symbols and call hierarchies on relative paths. Paths are now correctly resolved to their absolute form before parsing.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **Diagnostic Infrastructure Overhaul:**
  - **Unique Diagnostic Codes:** Introduced a standardized coding system with the `HOM` prefix (e.g., `HOM001` for Parse Errors, `HOM1002` for Building Levels). This enables easier filtering and future suppression rules.
  - **Diagnostic Related Information:** Implemented support for linking diagnostics to other parts of the codebase (e.g., linking a validation error to a specific building definition).
  - **New Diagnostic Tags:** Redundant localization version numbers are now tagged as `Unnecessary`, allowing editors to render them with faded/greyed-out styling.
  - **Unified Metadata:** All diagnostics now consistently report "Hearts of Modding" as their source for better attribution in the Problems view.
- **Workspace-Wide Awareness:**
  - **Automatic Workspace Scan:** The server can now perform a full recursive scan of all `.txt` and `.yml` files in the mod directory upon initialization.
  - **Toggleable Scanning:** This feature is **off by default** and can be enabled via `hoi4.validator.workspaceScan.enabled` or the new **HOI4: Toggle Workspace Scan** command.
  - **Custom Ignore Patterns:** Added `hoi4.validator.ignoreFiles` configuration. Supports regex patterns to completely exclude files or directories from diagnostics and intelligence features (References, Rename).
  - **Proactive Reporting:** You can now see all errors and warnings across your entire mod without needing to open every file manually.
  - **Mod Scope Isolation:** The full scan is strictly limited to the mod workspace, ensuring you aren't flooded with diagnostics from base game files.

### Changed

- **Improved Parser Robustness:**
  - Added support for `|` (pipe) and `*` (asterisk) characters in identifiers, fixing parsing errors in complex effect tooltips and SI-unit localization formatters.
  - Refactored internal diagnostic handling to a modular `validate_content` pipeline.
- **Internal Optimization:**
  - Cleaned up unused imports and suppressed dead code warnings across the server for a more stable build.
  - Improved workspace symbol search (`Ctrl+T`) by making fuzzy matching case-insensitive.

## [v0.2.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- MacOS ARM64 support.

### Changed

- Move README.md and CHANGELOG.md files from root into `client/` during extension compilation/packaging, otherwise the Marketplace is oblivious to them.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Bumped [vfast-uri](https://github.com/fastify/fast-uri) from v3.1.0 to v3.1.2 ([vsecurity update](https://github.com/fastify/fast-uri/releases/tag/v3.1.2)) | [vPR #1](https://github.com/emberglazee/hearts-of-modding/pull/1)

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

  - Added specialized tooltips for achievements featuring custom headers (🏆/🎀), localized name/description previews, and direct definition links.
  - Added validation for missing `_NAME` and `_DESC` localization keys.
- **Workspace Intelligence & Navigation:**
  - **LSP Rename:** Full support for renaming Events, Scripted Triggers, Scripted Effects, Ideas, and Variables across the entire mod.
  - **Call Hierarchy:** Added support for visualizing incoming and outgoing relationships for events and scripted entities.
  - **Workspace Symbols:** Added global fuzzy search (`Ctrl+T`) for all indexed HOI4 symbols (Events, Ideas, Traits, Achievements, Sprites, etc.).
  - **Document Symbols:** Added comprehensive outline view support for script files, categorizing logic into meaningful sections (Events, Focuses, Characters, etc.).
- **Advanced Validation Engine:**
  - Added `advanced_validation` module for complex logical checks.
  - **Deep Schema Validation (CWT Support):** Rewrote the schema engine to support the full CWTools specification, including cardinality (e.g., `## cardinality = 1..1`), severity levels, and recursive blocks.
  - **Enum Validation:** Now parses `shared_enums.cwt` to validate values against thousands of game-defined constants (DLCs, tech bonuses, etc.).
  - **Custom Mod Schemas:** Added support for project-level schemas; `.cwt` files in `.cwtools/` or `Config/` are automatically merged into the validation engine.
  - **Building Levels:** Validates that building levels in state history do not exceed their `max_level` defined in `common/buildings/`.
  - **Character Skills:** Validates character skill levels against limits defined in `common/defines/*.lua`.
  - **Victory Points:** Validates that victory point provinces are correctly located within their assigned state.
- **Rich Tooltips & Documentation:**
  - **Modifier Display:** Implemented a sophisticated modifier formatting service that converts snake_case to Title Case, handles percentage formatting, and uses ✓/✗ indicators for beneficial/detrimental effects.
  - **Enhanced Scopes:** Tooltips now show a "Scope Stack" to help track nested logic; added specialized headers for Achievement and Music contexts.
- **Localization Improvements:**
  - Expanded recognized localization commands from 15 to over 80 (e.g., `GetNameDefCap`, `GetPartySupport`).
  - Added support for localization version numbers in the parser.
  - Added detection and "Hint" diagnostics for unnecessary version numbers in localization files.

  - Achievement keywords (`possible`, `happened`, `ribbon`) now receive proper semantic highlighting.
- **Refined Parser:**
  - Improved identifier boundary checks and support for special characters.
  - Enhanced robustness when handling large blocks and complex assignments.

### Fixed

- Fixed color picker appearing for arbitrary sets of three numbers that weren't intended as colors.
- Fixed scope detection for state history files (properly identifying the `state` scope).
- Removed redundant achievement hover blocks that caused duplicate tooltips.
- Resolved various unused import and dead code warnings across the server.

## [v0.1.0] - 2024-05-09

### Added

- **Core Features:**
  - Initial implementation of CWT schema parsing for triggers and effects.
- **New Asset Scanners:**
  - Implemented Music scanner for `music/*.asset` and `music/*.txt` files. Tracks music assets, radio stations, and song assignments.
  - Implemented Sound scanner for `sound/*.asset` files. Tracks sounds, sound effects, falloffs, and categories.
- **Advanced Localization Support:**
  - Added first-class support for `.yml` localization files with full syntax highlighting and validation.
  - Added validation for bracketed scopes (e.g., `[vRoot.GetName]`) within localization strings.
  - Added validation for Paradox color codes (`§Y...§!`) and support for numeric color codes (`§5`).
  - Implemented "Cosmetic Localization Indentation" heuristic to improve visual hierarchy of localization variants (e.g., `_DEF`, `_ADJ`).
- **Refined Activation Logic:**
  - Added `hoi4.enabled` workspace setting to control extension activation per workspace.
  - Extension now prompts to enable itself when a `descriptor.mod` file is detected in a new workspace.
  - Language associations for `.txt` and `.yml` are now scoped to standard HOI4 directories (e.g., `common/`, `events/`, `localisation/`) to avoid hijacking unrelated files.
- **UI & Tooling Improvements:**
  - Added memory usage display for the language server in the status bar (toggleable via `hoi4.showMemoryUsage.enabled`).
  - Added emoji-based categorization in tooltips (🎵 for music, 📜 for rules, 🌐 for localization) to improve readability.
  - Hyperlinked file paths and textures in tooltips for direct navigation.
- **Styling & Formatting:**
  - Added code action to remove all trailing whitespaces in the file.
  - Added "Convert all mixed indentation to tabs in this file" code action.
- **Backend Enhancements (LSP Server):**
  - Updated parser to support identifiers starting with digits and containing special characters like `'` and `%`.
  - Improved robustness by handling UTF-8 BOM in script and localization files.
  - Expanded `Value::TaggedBlock` (e.g., `rgb { ... }`) to track internal ranges for better diagnostic precision.
  - Integrated `sysinfo` for real-time memory monitoring.

### Fixed

- Fixed not being able to parse bookmark files due to quoted identifiers for country tags.
- Fixed language server not reporting its memory usage correctly to the client.
- Fixed broad `.yml` file associations incorrectly applying to GitHub workflow files.
- Improved identifier boundary checks in the parser to prevent false positives for keywords like `yes`/`no` when part of a longer string.

## [v0.0.1] - 2026-04-26

Initial release.
